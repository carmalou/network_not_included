# Everything we do is online!

* Health care
* Education
* Documentation
* Finance
* Job search

It's amazing the changes that we've seen from collaboration -- and the internet is largely to thank for that. Because of the internet, we are able to communicate across the country and even further -- across the world. We've made massive strides and are able to work on opposite sides of the country from our work. Nurses are able to communicate with doctors almost simultaneously. Educational resources are constantly at our fingertips.

All of this is wonderful -- but it comes at a price. That price is anywhere between 50 and 200 per month, plus a modem and router, and a computer for access.

# If you aren't online, where are you?

???
If you aren't online, how can you search for work?
If you aren't online, how can you keep up with current events?
How can you view your financial data and keep up with your money?
Can you communicate with your family?
Keep up with school?

Largely the answer to these is no.

Talk about PHONES

Maybe talk about my experience without internet here? idk

# Internet Access By The Numbers

* 64% of Americans have smartphones, but of these 19% do not have consistent internet access beyond their phone
* 15% indicated that they owned a smartphone but had limited options for accessing the internet outside of their cellphones
* 10% indicated that they owned a smartphone but had no high-speed internet at home
* 7% indicated that they owned a cellphone but had limited options for access and no internet at home

???
I would be remiss not to mention cell phones, right? Smartphones are ubiquitious in the United States. Nearly everyone has one, but for many it is their only access to the internet.

64% of Americans have cell phones, but of those 19% don't have consistent internet access beyond their phone. This is roughly 36 million Americans.

To go further, 15% indicated that they have limited options for accessing the internet outside of their cellphone. This can mean being limited to the public library, or public spaces like Starbucks or other businesses offering internet.

Seven percent of people said they had a smart phone, but no home internet _and_ limited options for access.

# Why the lack of access?

* Age: 18-29 year olds are more likely to be smartphone dependent
* Income: 13% of Americans with incomes under $30k are smartphone-dependent
* Minorities: 13% of Latinos and 12% of African Americans are smartphone-dependent

???
The greatest predictor of having internet in your home is income. With internet ranging from $50/month to more than $200, plus hardware and a computer to surf the web, it can be difficult to justify. Even more it can simply be out of reach.

Cell phones can help bridge this gap.

# Access via smartphone is tenuous

* 48% of smartphone-dependent individuals have had to stop or cancel their plan due to cost
* 51% of smartphone-dependent individuals "occasionally" reach their maximum data allotment before their plan restarts
* 30% of smartphone-dependent individuals "frequently" reach their maximum data allotment before their plan restarts

???
Relying on smartphones to bridge the gap between access and no access is ill-advised. With a majority of smartphone-dependent individuals losing access due to cost, they are left unable to communicate, search for work, research health issues, and other everyday searches.

# So what does this mean for tech?

* Take apps offline
* Use local storage for heavy caching
* Make mobile apps with Ionic and React Native
* Downloadable documentation

???
We all know there is a pipeline problem. Women and underrepresented minorities are far too rare in tech. Make no mistake, without opportunities to learn and get online, the pipeline will not improve for women and minorities.

With hybrid mobile and desktop apps, we can take the Javascript we are already writing, and make our products more accessible to those who need them.
