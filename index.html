### How we can take tech offline to increase accessibility

???
Hey everyone. I'm super excited to talk to you about this today. Internet access is something that is very close to my heart. I know how fleeting it can be and how difficult it is when you don't have it. I've been interested in how to fix this issue for a long time, and I'm excited to share that with you all.

A little about me, I won't spend too much time here. I'd definitely recommend my blog...my twitter is a little more iffy.

# The Internet is kind of a big deal

???
Can you raise your hand if you were online today? It's kind of unfair since I'm talking to a room full of tech people, but it holds true for basically every industry today. And perhaps even more so outside of work.

# Everything we do is online!

* Health care
* Education
* Documentation
* Finance
* Job search

???
It's amazing the changes that we've seen from collaboration -- and the internet is largely to thank for that. Because of the internet, we are able to communicate across the country and even further -- across the world. We've made massive strides and are able to work on opposite sides of the country from our work. Nurses are able to communicate with doctors almost simultaneously. Educational resources are constantly at our fingertips.

All of this is wonderful -- but it comes at a price. That price is anywhere between 50 and 200 per month, plus a modem and router, and a computer for access.

# If you aren't online, where are you?

???
If you aren't online, how can you search for work?
If you aren't online, how can you keep up with current events?
How can you view your financial data and keep up with your money?
Can you communicate with your family?
Keep up with school?

Largely the answer to these is no.

You might be wondering about cell phones. Well mobile apps can help bridge the gap between access and none, if you have a smartphone and with data. And that's where things get a little dicey.

Maybe talk about my experience without internet here? idk

# Internet Access By The Numbers

* 64% of Americans have smartphones, but of these 19% do not have consistent internet access beyond their phone
* 15% indicated that they owned a smartphone but had limited options for accessing the internet outside of their cellphones
* 10% indicated that they owned a smartphone but had no high-speed internet at home
* 7% indicated that they owned a cellphone but had limited options for access and no internet at home

???
Smartphones, much like the web itself, are ubiquitious in the United States. It seems like nearly everyone has one, but for many it is their only access to the internet.

64% of Americans have cell phones, but of those 19% don't have consistent internet access beyond their phone. This is between 35 and 40 million Americans.

To go further, 15% indicated that they have limited options for accessing the internet outside of their cellphone. This can mean being limited to the public library, or public spaces like Starbucks or other businesses offering internet.

Seven percent of people said they had a smart phone, but no home internet _and_ limited options for access.

# Predictors of access

* Age: 18-29 year olds are more likely to be smartphone dependent
* Income: 13% of Americans with incomes under $30k are smartphone-dependent
* Minorities: 13% of Latinos and 12% of African Americans are smartphone-dependent

???
The greatest predictor of having internet in your home is income. With internet ranging from $50/month to more than $200, plus hardware and a computer to surf the web, it can be difficult to justify. Even more it can simply be out of reach.

Cell phones can help bridge this gap.

# Access via smartphone is tenuous

* 48% of smartphone-dependent individuals have had to stop or cancel their plan due to cost
* 51% of smartphone-dependent individuals "occasionally" reach their maximum data allotment before their plan restarts
* 30% of smartphone-dependent individuals "frequently" reach their maximum data allotment before their plan restarts

???
Relying on smartphones to bridge the gap between access and no access is ill-advised. With a majority of smartphone-dependent individuals losing access due to cost, they are left unable to communicate, search for work, research health issues, and other everyday searches.

# So what does this mean for tech?

* Take apps offline
* Make mobile apps with Ionic and React Native
* Downloadable documentation
* Use local storage for heavy caching

???
What really stood out for me when I was doing this research wasn't the fact that internet access is tenuous and based mostly on whether or not you can afford it. That actually didn't surprise me at all, and it makes sense. If you are under the poverty line it makes perfect sense that you won't have internet. What was striking for me was all this talk we hear today about getting more underrepresented minorities in the tech pipeline when according to the numbers, these are the very people most likely to be losing access.

It's difficult to imagine opportunities for people without access to the web, so what can we -- people who are already in tech -- do? With hybrid mobile and desktop apps, we can take the JavaScript we are already writing, and make our products more accessible to those who need them.

# Take apps offline

* Use Electron to make your app available without the web
  - Use event listeners to watch for Internet access and only run requests when connected
  - Use sqlite to save data to the machine to save on database calls

???
Electron is a framework from github that allows you to take your html and javascript files and serve them from the user's hard drive, instead of from a far-off webserver. This means we can take our web apps offline, and using other tooling built into the Chromium browser, we can provide the user a similar experience to the online version of our app.

We can use event listeners to check for connection, and pull and save data only when their is a connection. Further, we can bundle sqlite databases into our apps to save user data locally and forego database requests when possible.

# Make hybrid mobile apps

  - Similarly, you can check for network connectivity and run updates when you are connected
  - Make use of local storage or sqlite for storing data
  - Create small apps more often

???
We can increase access to our products by making them available via mobile. But it's important to be careful and considerate about how we access the data the app needs. If the user is working with a data cap, we don't want our app using up most or all of their data. So we can bundle more data into the app to reduce calls into an API. We can make small apps -- but write more of them -- to keep the file sizes reasonable and help balance between providing content but maintaining data capacity.

# Downloadable documentation

  - Complete docs are important!
  - Port them into an electron app similar to the electron API docs
  - Or a PDF is good too!

???
I can tell you from experience that it is incredibly difficult to learn when you don't have internet access. I would have loved to have had an offline version of Stack Overflow when I was first learning programming, because I didn't have internet at home. Offline docs are incredibly important, and Electron has done a great job with their offline API docs. The docs are complete and thorough, and show real examples of the code in production since the app is an Electron app.

That is a great example, but docs can be difficult enough without adding an entire new app to contain them. It doesn't have to be so fancy. It can be a matter of taking your readme and making it into a word doc that can be downloaded -- or a PDF. Something the user can keep on their computer locally.

# What if I can't take my app offline?

  - Take advantage of tools like offline.js, which allow you to stop ajax calls and restart them when you have a connection
  - Utilize localStorage to help store data locally
  - Consider what will happen when you lose connection
    * Will your user be able to continue their work?
    * How will you indicate that the app is down?
    * Can the user complete some tasks but not others?

???
Some apps are not going to work in an offline setting. News is event driven, healthcare requires passing data from provider to provider, and stores need their products to update. Does this mean that these aren't going to work in an offline Electron app? Not entirely. There are still methods to handle running these on the Desktop and gracefully fail when connection is lost.

The most important thing to considering what will happen when you lose connection _before_ it happens. Should the user see an error screen and nothing else? Should the user see a light version of the app where some features are available, but not others? Should they be able to continue with their work and save once they regain connection? These are the questions to answer when deciding how to handle a loss of connection.

# Key takeaways

- Use Electron to take your app offline
  * Take advantage of built-in tools like navigator.onLine to run ajax calls online when your app is online
- Bundle a database into your app like sqlite to store as much data locally as possible
- Be conscious of user limitations and think about how to handle loss of access in a graceful way

???
My number one goal from this talk was to bring awareness to this issue because when I've talked about it before, I've gotten surprise from people who didn't realize that access was as tenuous as it is. My next goal was to show you how we can use technology that we are already using -- namely JavaScript -- to help ease the transition of having a connection and losing it, and then coming back.

The most important thing is knowing this is something that _can_ be addressed, and considering how your app is going to address as the app is being written.
